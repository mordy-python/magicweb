# Magicweb

Magicweb is a simple web framework that is still under developement. It has a simple API to allow you to create your own web application quickly and easily.

view the [documentation](https://magicweb-docs.web.app/).

## Usage

### Installation

To install Magicweb you can run
`pip install Magicweb` or `pip3 install Magicweb`

To install Magicweb from source run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mordy-python/magicweb
cd magicweb
python setup.py install
```

### Run a basic app

To create a simple app we need to import Magicweb and create an app instance
we need to add the \_\_file\_\_ variable to the app instance.

```python
import magicweb
app = magicweb.Magicweb(__file__)
```

Once our app is instantiated we can add routes

```python
import magicweb
app = magicweb.Magicweb(__file__)

@app.route('/')
def index(request, response):
  response.text = "Hello"
@app.route('/rendered')
def rendered(request, response):
  app.render('index.html', response)
```

We created two routes, one that returns hello world, and one that renders an html page. All html pages should be in a directory named html, although this can be overrdden when instantiting the App class.

To run our app we need to use the `app.run()` function

```python
...
run(app)
# to run with a different host/port just add those arguments
# run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

We can also create routes with parameters

```python
import magicweb
app = magicweb.Magicweb(__file__)

@app.route('/{name}')
def index(request, response, name):
  response.text = "hello " + name
```
